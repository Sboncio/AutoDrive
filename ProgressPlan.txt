Need to make a plan on how to develop this system correctly with the least amount of errors as possible

Step 1 - Architecture
----------------------

- Be able to receive messages (msgs) from a turtlebot
	- Read and output the odometry
	- Read and output the laser scan

- Be able to publish command velocities to the turtlebot
	- Linear and angular

- Be able to retrieve a timeslice of the period

Step 2 - Mathematics
---------------------

- Be able to get the acceleration of the turtlebot
	- Linear acceleration
	- Angular acceleration

- Be able to get the allowable velocities of the turtlebot
	- Allowable linear velocities
	- Allowable Angular velocities

- Be able to get the braking distance of the turtlebot
